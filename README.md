# Today We Learned - TWL

Welcome to today we learned - TWL. This blog tries to encourage people who just started learning [Julia](https://julialang.org) to blog about their experience.

You learned something new but don't want to bother creating your own blog? Then you can just create a single post and share it with other newcomers and people interested in the Julia programming language.

Please check out [How to create a new post?](https://twl.opensourc.es/blog/how-to-create-a-new-post/) if you're interested. 

Currently there aren't any other example posts yet so you can be the first!
